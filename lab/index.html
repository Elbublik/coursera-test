		<p>My dad is amazing. It's 	funny, but I didn't know that until I
			<br>
			found out he was going to die.  That it was going to happen
			<br>
			soon.  That it was real.  Then I thought about a lot of stuff.
			<br>
			Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.  I guess I kind
			<br>
			of took him for granted or something.  I mean, our parents are
			<br>
			just always there.  You expect them to always be bugging you
			<br>
			to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or
			<br>
			try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one
			<br>
			day.  And make you get up early on the weekend to have
			<br>
			"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me
			<br>
			crazy.  I don't feel that way now.  Everything's different since
			<br>
			Dad got his diagnosis.  Since I realized that one day in the
			<br>
			near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.
			<p>
			Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that
			<br>
			question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-
			<br>
			sible. One day he won't be here to ask.     Now I feel lucky when I hear
			<br>
			his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-
			<br>
			ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.
